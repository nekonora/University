monkeypatching(5) --- CREATING NEW PATCHES
==========================================

All Patches are contained in modules in "$STASH_ROOT/lib/mlpatches".

The following Patchtypes are available:
   BasePatch():
      - does nothing
      - superclass for other patches
      - overwrite "PY2" and "PY3" with bools to define compatibility
      - overwrite "do_enable()" to enable the patch
      - overwrite "do_disable()" to disable the patch
      - overwrite "dependencies" with a list of patches to enable first
      - Most overwrite are optional and already done in the available subclasses.
   FunctionPatch():
      - replaces one attribute (=function, var, ...) in a module
      - overwrite "module" with the name of the module to apply the patch on
      - overwrite "function" with the name of the function go replace
      - overwrite "replacement" with the function to install
         INFO: due to a bug, the function needs to accept the patch as the first argument!
   ModulePatch():
      - replaces or insert the module in "sys.modules"
      - overwrite "name" with the name the module has in "sys.modules"
      - (OPTIONAL) overwrite "BASEPATH" to the parentdir of the module
         DEFAULT: "$STASH_ROOT/lib/mlpatches/modules/"
      - overwrite "relpath" with the path of the new module relative to "BASEPATH"
   PatchGroup():
      - overwrite "patches" with a list of patches
   VariablePatchGroup(patches):
      - like PatchGroup(), but patches passed to __init__()

The recommended way to define a Patch is the following way (example):

'''
from mlpatches import base
class MyPatch(base.FunctionPatch):
   PY2 = True
   PY3 = False
   module = "os"
   function = "system"
   replacement = my_function

MY_PATCH = MyPatch()
'''

ModulePatches should be defined in the "modulepatches"-submodule of mlpatches.
They need to be registered in "modulepatches.MODULE_PATCHES" dictionary.
This should be done in a hardcoded way.

All other Patches should be defined and instanciated in their own module.
They should then be imported in the "patches" submodule and registered in the "patches.(IN)STABLE_PATCHES" dictionary.
